<h2>Project Flipside: Getting serious about Pinoy ASR</h2>
<p>For my first entry, I’d like to talk a bit about Project Flipside.  I have always wanted to start this project and it’s already
long overdue.  It was during one of those days while doing my PhD that the idea came to mind.  There are many “initiatives” on
Filipino speech technology from different academic and research institutions in the Philippines, but the problem is the lack of
intention to be rigorous, to have integrity or have long-lasting effect in their outcomes.  I’m not just throwing criticisms
here to discredit anybody but it's happening and this is more of an outcry from frustration.  There are publications on developments
that supposedly report very high accuracies on their task, but aren’t really accessible once you start inquiring about them.
I myself understand that there are so many factors to consider on why mediocre research and sloppy science happens, especially
in progressive countries.  It may or may not be intentional, but pressure definitely plays a big part here.  My only hope is
that researchers who commit them would be willing to admit (even silently) and change their mindset for the better, instead of
embracing competitiveness by taking advantage of using shortcuts at a time when the country is already suffering from
brain-drain.</p>
<p>But I digress, although I really wanted to bring that out to light.</p>
<p>Going back to explaining the goals of Project Flipside.  First, the name.  While many consider the term “Flip” when referring to
Filipinos as being derogatory, I actually find it quite cool sounding.  It’s really all about whether you take these man-made
constructs too seriously.  The reason why I think Flipside is a good name is because I like to think of this project as an
alternative to what big tech companies have already been doing, focusing on the general techniques for rapid prototyping of
speech-based AI systems targetting many languages at once.  Similar to a macro- and micro-level view of things, I consider
general architectures (TDNN, Conformer), techniques (iVectors, SpecAugment) and approaches for rapid prototyping of systems for
multilingual targets as the “macro”.  And on the <i>flipside</i>, doing custom fine tuning to improve performance by taking advantage
of language-dependent peculiarities is the “micro”.  For example, using some form of language-specific subword modeling when
creating vocabularies for agglutinative languages.  I’m aware that programs such as BABEL and MATERIAL by IARPA in the US are
also doing these micro-level experiments to see what techniques benefit different languages in the low-resource category, but I
hope that they are more open to bring in more native speakers to learn about their findings.  The funny thing about these
programs, at least from my experience, is that it’s the evaluation sets that are harder to come by as opposed to the training
and development sets.  I’ve sent requests to some of their proponents but I always failed in acquiring those exclusive sets.</p>
<p>So at the onset, the first goal of this project is to establish standard datasets for benchmarking accuracies of models for
Filipino Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and hopefully, its related issues: voice activity detection, wake-up word, keyword
spotting, utterance segmentation, channel separation for mixed signals, and diarization, to name a few.  Of course, this means
that assumptions on audio and transcription formats, use case or topic domain, default segmentation, and channel conditions have
to be made.  I wanted to discuss about these in detail but I realized that its better to save it until the datasets are already
available to be distributed.  Speaking of availability, I also wish to include publicity and accessibility as part of the goals.
Right now we are at the transcription stages and I am in the process of recruiting the help of an organization for the validation
of the labels.  Another aspect that I didn’t immediately mention but I think is something that not many benchmarking datasets
address is that of recency, considering the fact that language evolves and buzzwords and trends change so fast.  A kind of
window-period-based versioning for the datasets must be put in place.  I hope that in the process of continuing this project,
this is something that we always take into account.  I am not a big fan of giga-corpora and I believe recency is the key to all
the hullabaloo against "stochastic parrots”.</p>
<p>The second short-term goal of the project is to showcase a running development of systems, with open source recipes that can be
proactively developed and versioned in a distributed manner, starting with ASR.  This is the part that will also require a huge
amount of effort and resources, but is also highly dependent on the first goal of creating the standard datasets.  Just in ASR,
for example, there are already so many baseline “macro-level" techniques out there, and usually the average researcher who is
only starting out will definitely get overwhelmed with the vast amount of concepts that they need to understand to truly say that
they haven’t left any stone unturned before catching up.  Imagine the horror of a legacy signal processing researcher who started
his career building systems on Janus, HTK, Julius and did a bit of Kaldi before the boom of deep learning.  How that person gets
pressured into moving directly to implement a deep learning-based hybrid CTC and attention-based system, while for the language
that person is working on, haven’t even established whether an acoustic unit for ephenthetic silence or word-piece modeling are
truly beneficial in the hybrid HMM-DNN system they are currently developing.  Not to mention, whether the statistical language
model or the post-decode rescoring set up is actually already optimal.  Those at the forefront would argue that these are trivial
issues, but the terrain of the playing field isn’t exactly flat — and those at the mountain peaks are just continually climbing
and not looking down at those still treading the valleys.  Speech AI, despite the strides that focus groups from big tech
companies have made, still moves quite glacial when compared to text-focused NLP and computer vision (CV).  I am always reminded
of this very nice Gradient series of articles by Alexander Veysov, where he talks about why this is the case.  But even that
article didn’t change the minds of some people (at least in my circle) who only sees the outputs coming from the NLP and CV
communities.  Even on the surface I can make a bunch of arguments: text and image is abundant and has a higher level of
universality than speech, and just by looking at the number of available annotation tools from surveys I found will give you an
idea (CV: 59, NLP: 14, and Speech: 4).  Speech AI is hard.  Oh my, I didn’t realize I’m already ranting too much.</p>
<p>I'm going to stop here before my pessimism blows out of proportion.  I guess this topic is going to need more entries in the
future and hopefully I don’t go off on tangents again.  Next time no more rants!  I really just wanted to have a first entry.</p>
<p>That’s all.</p>
